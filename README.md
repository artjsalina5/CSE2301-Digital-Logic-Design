  *(Note: The 6th edition works too!)*

---

## üéØ **What You'll Learn**

- **Combinational and Sequential Logic Circuits**
- **Digital Circuit Design using SSI and MSI components**
- **LogicWorks Software for Simulation and Testing**
- **Debugging, Timing Diagrams, and More!**
  
üåü This course is project-heavy and you‚Äôll be using **LogicWorks** for circuit design and simulation. Get ready to get hands-on with hardware and software.

---

## üßë‚Äçüî¨ **Lab Projects** (Up to 13)

Each lab involves:
- **Designing and Testing Circuits**
- **Using LogicWorks to Simulate**
- **Implementing Circuits with SSI & MSI Components**

üí° Pro Tip: Always demonstrate your results in lab sessions or office hours! Reports are crucial, so submit them unless otherwise noted.

> *Grades for labs will be 50% demo and 50% report.*

## üìä **Grading Breakdown**

| **Component**      | **Percentage**   |
|--------------------|------------------|
| **Exam 1**         | 10%              |
| **Exam 2**         | 15%              |
| **Exam 3**         | 20%              |
| **Final Exam**     | 25%              |
| **Lab Assignments**| 30%              |

To pass, you **must**:
- Score at least 60% in **both** labs and exams. Failure in one means failure overall.
