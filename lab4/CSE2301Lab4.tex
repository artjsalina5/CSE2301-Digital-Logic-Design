\subsubsection*{Karnaugh Maps in Depth}
Looking back at last week's answer,
\begin{examp}
\vspace{3mm}
\textbf{Karnaugh Map for \(\bm{\sum m(0, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 10, 12)}\)}
\begin{center}
\begin{karnaugh-map}(label=corner)[4][4][1][$D$][$C$][$B$][$A$]
\minterms{0,2,3,4,6,7,8,10,12}
\autoterms[0]
\implicantcorner
\implicant{3}{6}
\implicant{0}{8}
\end{karnaugh-map}
\end{center}
\textit{This produces:}
\[
	F(A,B,C,D) = \closure{A}C + \closure{B}\closure{D} + \closure{C}\closure{D}
\]
\[
	F(A,B,C,D) = \closure{A}C + \closure{D}(\closure{B} + \closure{C}) \quad \text{\textit{(Distribution)}}
\]
\end{examp}
% % ] Display an understanding of minimizing equations with Karnaugh Maps in
% your own words. How are they set up and how do you use them? Why do we
% need “don’t care” states (boxes marked with an X)?

Karnaugh maps, are a tabular, graphical way to simplify Boolean expressions by grouping terms into a grid
based on their truth tables. Each square in a K-map represents a
\textbf{minterm}, which corresponds to a \textit{unique} combination of
variable values. These minterms are placed such that adjacent squares differ
only by one variable, which allows for the user to easily identify
opportunities for simplification. These are ordered in a Grey code.

There are actually multiple ways to organize a K-map, but the most general
process involves circling adjacent squares that contain a 1, or \textbf{TRUE}
value. By grouping these \textbf{TRUE} values in the largest possible
rectangles, we can cancel out variables that appear in both true and
complimented form.

A \textbf{"Don't Care"} state is marked with an \(X\). These are used when a
certain input combination does not impact the desired output. ``Don’t care”
states, marked with an \(X\) are used when certain input combinations do not
impact the output or are not possible in the design. These states can be
treated as either 1 or 0, depending on whether they help in forming larger
groups, further reducing the complexity of the Boolean expression.

\subsubsection*{Why are "Don’t Care" states useful?}
They provide flexibility in simplifying the logic. Since their output \textit{doesn't
	matter}, they can be grouped with the 1’s to create larger rectangles, thus
reducing the number of terms in the final Boolean equation.
\begin{examp}
	\textbf{POSTNET and XS3 Encoding:}
	\begin{list}{-}{\leftmargin=1em \itemindent=0em}
		\item \textbf{POSTNET}: Postal Numeric Encoding Technique, used by the
		      U.S. Postal Service to encode ZIP codes into barcodes. It uses a
		      2-out-of-5 code where each digit is represented by five bars, and
		      exactly two of the bars are tall. The weighting used to decode
		      these bars is 74210, meaning the bars have respective weights of
		      \(7, 4, 2, 1, 0\).
		\item \textbf{XS3} (Excess-3): A binary-coded
		      decimal (BCD) system where each digit is represented by its binary
		      equivalent plus 3 (hence the term "excess-3"). For example, the
		      decimal number 5 is represented in \(XS3\) as \(0100_2\) (since 5 +
		      3 = 8 in binary).
	\end{list}
\end{examp}

\subsubsection*{Number of Non-Valid Input Codes}

To determine how many non-valid input codes are in your circuit, you need to
consider the total number of possible input combinations based on the number of
inputs. Let’s assume there are \(n\) inputs. Non-valid input codes are those combinations
that the circuit is not designed to handle or those that result in undefined behavior,
typically represented as "don't care" states in the Karnaugh map (K-map).

Given that each bit can only be either \(0\) or \(1\), there are a total of \(2^n\) possible input combinations.
For instance, if there are \(5\) inputs, there would be \(2^5 = 32\) possible combinations.
If we have specific output codes for the decimal numbers \(0\) through \(9\),
assuming these represent valid input combinations, we can calculate the number of non-valid input codes by subtracting the number of valid input codes from the total number of possible input combinations. Therefore:
\[
	\text{Number of Non-Valid Input Codes} = 2^n - 10
\]
For \(n = 5\), this would be:
\[
	\text{Number of Non-Valid Input Codes} = 32 - 10 = 22
\]
\subsection*{Discussion}
This was a very interesting lab, as it allowed me to delve deeper into utilizing the protoboard to model the circuits made in Logicworks 5. I had personally never looked into what POSTNET entails and how the data is encoded into the mail barcodes. I also found the conversion of binary to ternary and hexadecimal to be quite fascinating. I was able to understand the process of converting between different number systems and how to use Karnaugh maps to simplify Boolean expressions. I also learned about the importance of "don't care" states in Karnaugh maps and how they can be used to simplify logic expressions. I found the lab to be very informative and engaging, and I look forward to applying these concepts in future labs and projects.

Karnaugh maps have always been something that I wish I had taken the time to learn way back during Digital in Navy Nuke School, but we simply did not have the time to learn. Diving deeper into the different possible hazards during design and understanding what the timing diagrams really mean was also a great learning experience.


\subsection*{POSTNET Implementation}
\includegraphics[scale=.60]{postnetimp}
\begin{examp}
	\textbf{POSTNET} for Groton, CT\\
	\vspace{.5cm}
	The ZIP code for Groton, CT is 06340-6049. This translates to:
	\begin{center}
		\begin{pspicture}(15in,10in)
			\psbarcode{063406049}{includetext}{postnet}
		\end{pspicture}
	\end{center}
\end{examp}
And now for some conversion examples:
\begin{examp}
	\textbf{Conversion of Binary to Ternary and Hexadecimal}\newline
	Given the binary number \( 11010010_2 \), we first convert it to decimal.
	\newline
	\textbf{Binary to Decimal}

	\[
		1 \cdot 2^7 + 1 \cdot 2^6 + 0 \cdot 2^5 + 1 \cdot 2^4 + 0 \cdot 2^3 + 0 \cdot 2^2 + 1 \cdot 2^1 + 0 \cdot 2^0 \]
	\[= 128 + 64 + 0 + 16 + 0 + 0 + 2 + 0\]
	\[= 210_{10}\]
	\newline
	\textbf{Decimal to Ternary}

	To convert decimal \(210_{10}\) to ternary, we repeatedly divide the number by 3 and record the remainders:

	\begin{center}
		\begin{tabular}{cccc}
			Dividend & Divisor & Quotient & Remainder \\
			\hline
			210      & 3       & 70       & 0         \\
			70       & 3       & 23       & 1         \\
			23       & 3       & 7        & 2         \\
			7        & 3       & 2        & 1         \\
			2        & 3       & 0        & 2         \\
		\end{tabular}
	\end{center}

	Reading the remainders from bottom to top gives \(21210_3\).
	\vspace{3mm}
	\newline
	\textbf{Decimal to Hexadecimal}

	Similarly, to convert decimal \(210_{10}\) to hexadecimal, we divide by 16:
	\begin{center}
		\begin{tabular}{cccc}
			Dividend & Divisor & Quotient & Remainder \\
			\hline
			210      & 16      & 13       & 2         \\
			13       & 16      & 0        & 13        \\
		\end{tabular}
	\end{center}

	The remainder \(13\) corresponds to hexadecimal digit \(D\), and \(2\) is itself. Therefore, the number \(210_{10}\) in hexadecimal is \(D2_{16}\).

	\textbf{Summary:}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The binary number \(11010010_2\) converts to \(210_{10}\) in decimal.
		\item The decimal number \(210_{10}\) converts to \(21210_3\) in ternary.
		\item The decimal number \(210_{10}\) converts to \(D2_{16}\) in hexadecimal.
	\end{itemize}
